# Clang LibTooling Usage
This file gives a brief introduction of LibTooling usage.

##Source
The source file origins from [Clang LibTooling Example](http://kevinaboos.blogspot.com/2013/07/clang-tutorial-part-ii-libtooling.html). However, due to the rapid change of Clang API, I have modified some code to support the newest Clang 3.8 and compeletly changed the makefile.

##Function of the source file
Rewrite some part of the program.

##Usage
```
$ make
$ ./run_example.sh
```

Make sure the permission of execution.
