#Clang basic usage
This repository follow my [blog](), which gives an introduction of Clang basics. It is inspired by [this blog](https://kevinaboos.wordpress.com/2013/07/23/clang-tutorial-part-i-introduction/), and I have modified some codes to be suitalbe for the newest Clang 3.8.

##What changes most?
I think the notion of smart pointer in C++11 is becoming more and more popular because of its safty. So, the Clang seems to change all possible pointer to smart pointers. Also, due to the rapid change of Clang API, I have changed some other codes.

##Usage
See details in each subdirectory.
